\section{One-Sided Limits}

We can extend these same concepts and definitions to the idea of a one-sided limit...

$\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$ means ``What value does $f(x)$ approach as $x$ approaches $a$ only from the right side?''

$\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$ means ``What value does $f(x)$ approach as $x$ approaches $a$ only from the left side?''
