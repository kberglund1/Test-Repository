The computation we just did plugged 3 into $f(x)$ and tells us $f(3)$. It does not necessarily tell us $\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x^2-1}{x-1}$.

Since the limit is supposed to be telling us what the $y$-value is near when $x$ is near $3$, we can estimate this by plugging in numbers near $3$, such as
\[
    2.9, 2.99, 2.999, \ldots, 3.001, 3.01, 3.1
\]

    \item \link[I need a little help:]{whatisalimit-06-lesson3short} Watch a shortened video.
