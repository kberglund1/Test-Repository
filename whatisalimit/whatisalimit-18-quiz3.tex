\subsection{Quiz: criteria for continuity}

\begin{question}
Which of the following is NOT a criteria for continuity at $x=a$? (You have one attempt.)
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice{The function is defined at the point $x=a$}
\choice{The limit as $x$ approaches $a$ exists}
\choice{The limit as $x$ approaches $a$ is equal to the function value at $a$}
\choice[correct]{The function has no sharp turns or oscillations near $x=a$.}
\end{multipleChoice} 

\begin{explanation}
     That's right! The function has no sharp turns or oscillations near $x=a$ is not required for continuity.
 \end{explanation} 
\end{question}
