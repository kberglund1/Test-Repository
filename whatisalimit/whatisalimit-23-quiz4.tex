\begin{question}
Use continuity to find this limit: \[ \lim_{x \to \pi} \sin(x) \]
\begin{multipleChoice}  
\choice[correct]{0, because $\sin(\pi) = 0$.}
\choice{0 because if we plug numbers near $\pi$ like $3.1$, $3.14$, and $3.15$ into $\sin(x)$, we get out very small values.}
\choice{We don't know how to find the exact value of this limit yet.}  
\end{multipleChoice}  

\begin{explanation}
    That's right! Since we know that $\sin(x)$ is continuous at $x = \pi$, we know that the limit as $x \to \pi$ is equal to what we get when we plug $\pi$ into $\sin(x)$.
\end{explanation}
