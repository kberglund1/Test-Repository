To use an expandable environment, go like this:
\begin{expandable}
Hello!
\end{expandable}

Likewise, you can have a foldable environment:
\begin{foldable}
Hello!
\end{foldable}

Weird things happen when you put align* environments inside of expandable environments:

\begin{expandable}
This is a series of steps to simplify an equation:
\begin{align*}
2 + 2 & = x \\
4 & = x
\end{align*}
\end{expandable}

However, if you're not using align* environments, these look very nice contained in explanation environments as ways to hide solutions until students are ready to view them. 
\begin{explanation}
	\begin{expandable}
		Here's some math: $2 + 2 = 4$. 
	\end{expandable}
\end{explanation}
